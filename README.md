## How to launch the project  
To use this project, first of all clone it on your machine on any directory you prefer.

Then you need to create a virtual environment in the directory and install the dipendecies there

This is my favourite way of doing it


```bash
  python -m venv some_name_for_your_venv
```  

Next, activate the environment

on windows:
```bash
  .\your_venv_name\Scripts\activate
``` 
on linux:
```bash
  source\your_venv_name\bin\activate
``` 
Then go ahead and install the essential requirements for this project


```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```  


Finally you need to apply the migrations to create a database for the project
```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
```  
```bash
  python manage.py migrate
```  

# For the first use

before you run the server, you need to create a superuser for admin pannell.

```bash
  python manage.py createsuperuser
```
choose a username, email and password<br />
Now you're good to go. just run the project with this command

```bash
  python manage.py runserver
```

Open a browser and head to the [admin pannell](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/) and enjoy

# for the later use

After you used the system for the first time, there is no need to do all the process presented above anymore, from now on you just need to activate the virtual environment and run the server 
# Developement
* this project is still under developement and not fully compeleted and will be updated reguallary over time

* I'll try to write a bash script to automate the process of running the system so it can be easier to use for none programmers

* If you prefer to use another database like PostgreSQL or MySQL it's totally fine
