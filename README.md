## How to launch the project  
To deploy this project clone it on your machine.

First of all you need to create a virtual environment in the directory and install the dipendecies there

This is my favourite way of doing it


```bash
  python -m venv some_name_for_your_venv
```  

Next, activate the environment

on windows:
```bash
  .\your_venv_name\Scripts\activate
``` 
on linux:
```bash
  source\your_venv_name\bin\activate
``` 
Then go ahead and install the essential requirements for this project


```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```  


Finally you need to apply the migrations to create a database
```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
```  
```bash
  python manage.py migrate
```  

Now you're good to go. just run the project with this command


```bash
  python manage.py runserver
```  
I'll try to write a bash script to automate these levels so it can be easier to use for none programmers

If you prefer to use another database like PostgreSQL or MySQL it's totally fine
